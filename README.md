 In this Project i build the model that’s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity like threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate better than Perspective’s current models. You’ll be using a dataset of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits. Improvements to the current model will hopefully help online discussion become more productive and respectful.
## Abstract- :
A large proportion of online comments present on public domains are usually constructive, however a significant proportion are toxic in nature. Dataset is obtained online which
are processed to remove noise from the dataset. The comments contain lot of errors which increases the number of features manifold, making the machine learning model to train the
dataset by processing the dataset, in the form of transformation of raw comments before feeding it to the Classification models using a machine learning technique known as the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) technique. 
## Introduction :
over the years, social media and social networking usehave been increasing exponentially due to an upsurge inthe use of the internet. Flood of information arises from online
conversation in a daily basis as people are able to discuss,express themselves and air their opinion via these platforms.While this situation is highly productive and could contributesignificantly to the quality of human life, it could also be destructive and enormously dangerous. While discussion or a conversation is opened, it is quite obvious that debates may arise due to differences in opinion

## Conclusion :
from thiis we conclude that harmful or toxic comments in the social media space have many negative impacts to society. The ability to readily and accurately identify comments as toxic could provide many benefits while mitigating the harm.
